# WAYPOINT: STABLE WORKING STATE ✅
**Date**: June 6, 2025  
**Status**: Custom Prompt System Fully Operational

## Verified Working Components:
- ✅ Custom prompt storage in database (customPrompt field)
- ✅ TwiML endpoint retrieves and uses custom prompts correctly
- ✅ Enhanced logging with detailed prompt tracking
- ✅ Clean TwiML generation without SSML errors
- ✅ Route conflicts resolved (hardcoded handler removed)
- ✅ Proper fallback to default healthcare message
- ✅ Basic call recording functionality

## Current Call Flow:
1. Custom prompt stored in database
2. Twilio calls TwiML endpoint
3. System retrieves custom prompt from database
4. TwiML generated with custom message
5. Patient hears custom prompt and responds
6. Recording captured and stored
7. Call ends
