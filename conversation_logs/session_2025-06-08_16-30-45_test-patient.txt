[16:30:45] AI: Hello, this is CardioCare AI calling for your post-discharge follow-up. Is this Test Patient?

[16:30:48] Patient: Yes, this is me.

[16:30:50] AI: Great! I'm calling to check on how you're feeling after your recent hospital visit. How are you doing today?

[16:30:55] Patient: I'm feeling much better, thank you. The chest pain has mostly gone away.

[16:31:02] AI: That's wonderful to hear. Are you taking your prescribed medications as directed?

[16:31:05] Patient: Yes, I'm taking the blood pressure medication twice a day as instructed.

[16:31:12] AI: Excellent. Have you experienced any side effects from the medication?

[16:31:15] Patient: No side effects so far. I feel good.

[16:31:20] AI: That's great news. Do you have any questions or concerns about your recovery?

[16:31:25] Patient: Actually, yes. When can I start exercising again?

[16:31:30] AI: That's an important question. For cardiac patients, we typically recommend starting with light walking after discharge. However, you should discuss a specific exercise plan with your cardiologist during your follow-up appointment. Have you scheduled that appointment yet?

[16:31:45] Patient: Yes, it's scheduled for next Tuesday.

[16:31:48] AI: Perfect. Please bring up your exercise questions during that visit. Is there anything else you'd like to discuss today?

[16:31:55] Patient: No, I think that covers everything.

[16:31:58] AI: Wonderful. Thank you for taking this call. Please don't hesitate to contact your healthcare team if you have any concerns. Take care!

[16:32:02] Patient: Thank you, goodbye.

[16:32:05] AI: Goodbye!
