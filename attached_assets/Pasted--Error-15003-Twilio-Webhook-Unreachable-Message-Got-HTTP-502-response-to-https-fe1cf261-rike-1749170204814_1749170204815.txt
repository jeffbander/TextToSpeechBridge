❌ Error 15003 – Twilio Webhook Unreachable
Message:
Got HTTP 502 response to https://fe1cf261...riker.replit.dev/api/calls/webhook
Root cause: Replit could not serve the webhook URL, returning a 502 Bad Gateway.

🔎 Diagnosis
Twilio tried to hit your statusCallback webhook at:

bash
Copy
Edit
https://fe1cf261-...riker.replit.dev/api/calls/webhook
But Replit was not able to serve the request, responding with:

go
Copy
Edit
replit-proxy-error: repl unreachable
✅ Confirmation from Twilio Logs:
✅ Call was created successfully

✅ SIP response = 200 OK

❌ Webhook to /api/calls/webhook failed with 502

🛠️ Solution Options
Option 1: Check if your Replit server is running
Open your Replit IDE.

Make sure the web server (e.g. Express, Fastify, etc.) is running and actively listening.

Your server must be bound to 0.0.0.0 and not just localhost, e.g.:

ts
Copy
Edit
app.listen(5000, '0.0.0.0', () => {
  console.log('Server running');
});
Otherwise, Replit's reverse proxy can't expose the port to the public internet.

Option 2: Replace Replit with a more reliable host
Replit often goes to sleep or becomes unreachable unless you're using a premium plan.

Use one of the following instead:

Glitch.com

Render.com (free tier)

Fly.io

Ngrok – for local development and testing (map localhost to a public domain)

Option 3: Verify Public Accessibility
Test the webhook endpoint manually:

bash
Copy
Edit
curl https://fe1cf261-...replit.dev/api/calls/webhook
If it hangs or returns a 502, then Twilio is also failing.

Option 4: Add a simple health check route
Make sure your Express app has:

ts
Copy
Edit
app.get('/health', (req, res) => {
  res.send('OK');
});
Then test:

bash
Copy
Edit
curl https://your-public-domain/health
🔁 While Developing
Temporarily test using:

bash
Copy
Edit
npx localtunnel --port 5000
It gives you a public URL like https://shiny-wolf.loca.lt/, which you can plug into Twilio as your webhook domain.

Let me know if you'd like a deployable server template (Express, Fastify, etc.) on a stable host — or want to automate Twilio call creation + logging.
