Assessment and Plan
 
Assessment: Dora is a 64 y.o. female who has a history significant for diabetes 
 
Regarding her dyspnea on exertion:
- EKG [05/2025] shows sinus rhythm, marked mid and left precordial repolarization disturbance, consider ischemia or LV overload
-We will check a echocardiogram to assess her LV size, function and valves.
-Given her exertional symptoms which resolved with rest and known risk factor of diabetes, we will check a nuclear stress test to assist with coronary artery disease risk stratification
 
her blood pressure today was elevated at 159/73 mmHg on arrival.
            - Of note, Dora was taking motrin for 7 months for her sciatica. We will consider starting her on antihypertensives at follow up pending results of her echocardiogram
 
We discussed exercising for 30-45 minutes on most days of the week, maintaining a healthy weight and following a low-salt, heart-healthy diet. Otherwise, we will see Dora back to review the results of her nuclear stress test and to check an echocardiogram.

**Assessment and Plan**  
──────────────────────────────  
Assessment:  
1. Chest Pain:  
   • Mr. Chacho is a 54-year-old male with a two-year history of recurrent chest pain. He reports episodes lasting 5–10 minutes that occur approximately two times a month. It is unclear if these episodes are exertional or random, though they have limited his exercise tolerance.  
2. Pre-operative Evaluation:  
   • The patient is scheduled for surgery on 06/25. Pre-operative cardiac clearance is recommended, and surgery should be deferred until completion and review of the cardiac testing outlined below.  
3. Risk Factors:  
   • Occasional high blood pressure attributed to elevated triglycerides. Fasting lipid profile and diabetes screening are pending.

Plan:  
• Cardiac Testing:  
   - Schedule a nuclear stress test for coronary artery disease risk stratification.  
   - Schedule an echocardiogram to assess left ventricular function and valve status.  
   - Defer surgery until these studies are completed and reviewed by cardiology.  
• Laboratory Testing:  
   - Obtain fasting blood work including lipid profile and diabetes screening as part of pre-operative work-up.  
• Lifestyle Modifications:  
   - Exercise 30–45 minutes on most days of the week.  
   - Maintain a healthy weight and follow a low-salt, heart-healthy diet.  
• Follow-Up:  
   - Review stress test, echocardiogram, and laboratory results once available.  
   - Proceed with surgery only after cardiology clearance is granted.  
   - If any new symptoms occur prior to surgery, the patient is to contact our office promptly.

Medication:  
• No current medications; no changes at this time.

Patient counseled on acute issues and verbalized understanding of the plan.  
──────────────────────────────  

*** Cardiovascular Risk Evaluation ***  
Jose is not presently optimized or stable to proceed with the planned surgery pending completion and review of the stress test and echocardiogram. Once results are available and cardiology clearance is obtained, we will update instructions regarding medication management and coordinate with the surgical team.",

Assessment and Plan:
------------------------------------------------------
Assessment:  
Faiga is an 18-year-old female with a history of persistent palpitations. She reports feeling her heart pounding constantly—even at rest but more noticeable during exercise—with associated shortness of breath and weakness. There is no significant family history of premature cardiac events, and the patient is not taking any medications.

Plan:  
Palpitations Evaluation:  
 • Order a 4-week Event Monitor to assess for significant arrhythmias, pauses, or AV block.  
 • Obtain an echocardiogram to evaluate left ventricular size, function, and the cardiac valves.  
 • Advise the patient on lifestyle modifications including exercising for 30–45 minutes on most days of the week, maintaining a healthy weight, and following a low-salt, heart-healthy diet.  
 • No cardiac medications are indicated at this time.  
 • Laboratory Evaluation: No blood work is ordered today; will consider thyroid function tests, CBC, and metabolic panel at follow-up based on clinical assessment, particularly if weakness persists or worsens.  

Follow-up:  
 • Reassess in 6 months with repeat evaluation.

Patient was counseled regarding the plan, and she verbalized understanding.

Assessment and Plan
 
Assessment: Esther is a 62 y.o. female who has a past medical history of Asthma (6/24/2014), Asthma, Breast cancer, Chest pain (6/24/2014), Hyperlipidemia, S/P lumpectomy, right breast (8/05 and 9/05), and SOB (shortness of breath) on exertion (6/24/2014).
 
She has no past medical history of Melanoma or Nonmelanoma skin cancer.
 
Briefly, Ms. Dick has a history significant for hypotension, hyperlipidemia, coronary artery disease, breast cancer [2005], COVID-19 [11/2022], pre-diabetes.
 
Regarding her coronary artery disease: 
- EKG [07/22/2024] - sinus rhythm. Unchanged from prior. 
- Coronary CT [05/2014] - calcium score of 10 [87th percentile]. Mild but premature calcified coronary plaque, large portion of the stomach herniated into the chest (para-esophageal hernia is difficult to exclude).
- TTE [01/2021] - shows LVEF of 65% with  no evidence of significant valvular regurgitation. 
- Stress echocardiogram [11/2021] - Resting echocardiogram: hyperdynamic left ventricular systolic function, LVEF of 70%, aortic valve sclerosis, mitral annular fibrocalcification, mild pulmonary hypertension [PA systolic pressure 32 mmHg, RAP 5 mmHg]. Stress echocardiogram: no echo evidence of physiologically significant coronary artery disease.
- MPI [09/20/2023] - normal myocardial perfusion. 10 METS. 
- Esther is on anastrozole due to history of breast cancer. 
            - We will consider checking an echo with strain at follow up. 
- Continue Coq10 200 mg daily 
- Continue lipitor 10 mg daily
            - Recent LDL was 42 [11/2022] which is at recommended range of less than 70
            - We advised Esther to check lipid panel with PCP. 
- We discussed that her symptoms are less likely cardiac in etiology. Advised to follow up with PCP. 
 
Regarding her hypotension:
-Esther's blood pressure today is normal  with a reading of 123/78 mmHg on arrival.
- Continue midodrine 2.5 mg twice daily as needed
            - Continue 1 teaspoon of table salt between 2 glasses of water as instructed
-I advised Esther to monitor her blood pressure at home regularly and to keep a log of her readings.
 
We discussed exercising for 30-45 minutes on most days of the week, maintaining a healthy weight and following a low-salt, heart-healthy diet. Otherwise, we will see Esther back in 1 year for a follow up.

***Assessment and Plan***:

Revised Assessment and Plan for Today's Follow-up (06/11/25):

Assessment:  
Joseph Fisch is a 40-year-old male (DOB: 10/19/1984) with no personal medical history. He has a significant family history with two maternal uncles with heart disease – one had a heart attack (around age 50) and the other required a stent. He is asymptomatic with no chest pain or shortness of breath and reports being able to walk 10 blocks without limitation.

Coronary Artery Disease (CAD) Risk Stratification:  
• Patient is asymptomatic with a normal EKG showing no ST-T wave changes.  
• His blood pressure today is 122/80 mmHg.  
• Recent blood work (06/2024) shows LDL at 77 mg/dL.  
• Discussion included the recommendation of obtaining a calcium score (a low-dose CT scan of the heart) to assess for early signs of calcification due to his family history. The test is not covered by insurance and will cost $108 out-of-pocket.  
• We reviewed the importance of maintaining a healthy lifestyle including exercising for 30–45 minutes on most days, maintaining a healthy weight, and following a low-salt, heart-healthy diet.

Plan:  
1. If the patient is interested in further clarifying his coronary risk given his family history, he may pursue a calcium score test. (Note: The calcium score is a low-dose CT scan of the heart and costs $108 out-of-pocket.)  
2. Continue current lifestyle measures: exercise (30–45 minutes on most days), maintain a healthy weight, and follow a low-salt, heart-healthy diet.  
3. Since all parameters (BP, LDL, EKG) are normal and no personal cardiac issues are evident, routine follow-up is recommended in 5 years unless symptoms develop.

Patient was counseled on these points and verbalized understanding.

Assessment and Plan
 
Assessment: Josef is a 74 y.o. male who has a past medical history of COVID-19 (11/2020), Crohn disease, Essential (primary) hypertension, Kidney stone, and Other diseases of vocal cords (11/22/2021).
 
He has no past medical history of Arthritis, Asthma, Blood transfusion abn reaction or complication, no procedure mishap, Cancer, Diabetes mellitus, Stroke, or Thyroid disease.
 
Briefly, Mr. Friedman has a history significant for coronary artery disease, atrial fibrillation, hypertension, Crohn's disease, COVID-19 PNA [10/2020]. 
 
Regarding his mitral and aortic regurgitation:
- TTE [03/2024] - mild concentric remodeling of LV, grade I diastolic dysfunction with EF of 63%, mild mitral regurgitation
            - Compared to prior TTE [09/2022], previously noted interatrial septal aneurysm and LA dilation.
 
Regarding his atrial fibrillation with CHADVASC score of 2 [HTN, Age]:
- EKG [12/11/2024] - shows sinus bradycardia [52 bpm] with 1st degree AV block.
            - Compared to prior EKG [07/01/2024], newly noted 1st degree AV block and previously noted LVH.
- Event Monitor [05/09/2024 - 05/22/2024] - no AF burden, 3 episodes of 1st degree Heart Block with slowest at 52 bpm, 1% PVC burden, 2% PAC burden, avg HR 63 bpm [49-114 bpm]. 
            - Last visit, we referred Josef to Dr. Miller for a possible AFIB ablation.
- Dr. Miller's note [08/19/2024]: While it's certainly possible he has AF, I have not seen any evidence of it (and its not clear that it was necessarily ever seen on an ECG or monitor). We discussed that we will send him a two week event monitor for further evaluation. If there is no evidence of AF on the monitor, then we discussed the option of implanting an internal loop recording for long term monitoring.
- Continue eliquis 5 mg BID.
- Continue metoprolol succinate 25 mg daily. 
 
Regarding his coronary artery disease:
- MPI [09/2022] - normal myocardial perfusion, 9 METS, however the ECG response was equivocal and showed ST depression [1.5 mm] in leads II, III and V6. 
- CCTA [10/2022] - calcium score 2 [13th percentile], mild calcified aortic plaque.
            - <25% stenosis of proximal LAD, proximal LCx
            - Concentric LVH
            - Stable findings of diffuse bilateral lower lobe predominant interstitial disease
- Josef is on eliquis for AFIB
- Continue beta blocker as above.
- Continue atorvastatin 10 mg daily.
            - Recent LDL was 33 [12/2023]
  
Regarding his hypertension:
- Blood pressure today is borderline low with a reading of 98/57 mmHg on arrival. 
            - BP is low off of all HTN medications. We discussed that it could be due to lack of salt in his diet given kidney stones. 
- Per PA Gewanter [endocrinology at ODA], endocrinology workup was unrevealing.
- PYP scan [09/2024] - Not suggestive of TTR amyloid: A semi-quantitative visual score of 0 or H/CL ratio < 1.
- Continue to hold amlodipine 5 mg daily, per his PCP
- Continue to hold lasix 20 mg daily, per his PCP
- Medication intolerance: verapamil [dizziness]
- I advised Josef to monitor his blood pressure at home regularly and to keep a log of his readings. 
 
CC: Dr. Berlin [Fax: 866-265-2695]
 
We discussed the importance of maintaining a low sodium heart healthy diet and regular exercise as part of conservative management of his hypertension. Otherwise, we will see Josef back in 6 months for follow up.

Assessment and Plan
 
Assessment: Louis is a 63 y.o. male who  has a past medical history of CAD (coronary artery disease), CHF (congestive heart failure), Coronary artery disease, Essential (primary) hypertension, HLD (hyperlipidemia), and Sleep apnea, unspecified.
 
Briefly, Mr. Jacobowitz has a history significant for hypertension, hyperlipidemia, coronary artery disease, sleep apnea, and gout.
 
Regarding his coronary artery disease:
- EKG today shows sinus rhythm, possible anterior infarct.
            - Compared to prior EKG [04/17/2024] - newly noted possible anterior infarct.
- CCTA [03/2023] - There is premature calcified coronary plaque. Calcium score 281.
            - Near 50% stenosis of proximal RPDA [noncalcified plaque, evaluation partially limited due to motion artifact]
- 25-50% (closer to 50%) stenosis of mid LAD [mixed plaque], ostial D1 [calcified plaque], ostial/proximal RCA, mid RCA [mixed plaque, evaluation limited due to motion artifact]
- <25% stenosis of proximal LAD [calcified plaque], ostial/proximal non-dominant LCx [mixed plaque]
- Other findings: Dilated left atrium. Mildly dilated pulmonary artery (3.0cm). Dilated ascending aorta (4.5 x 4.3cm). Dilated descending aorta (3.3 x 3.2cm). Mildly dilated aortic root (4.0cm). Tortuous descending aorta.
- CT-FFR: normal LM [1.0], normal LAD [0.83], normal LCx [0.93], normal D1 [0.96], normal RCA [0.98], abnormal RPDA [0.72]. Based on FFR CT analysis, there is a high likelihood of flow-limitation in RPDA.
- TTE [06/2023] - concentric LV remodeling, LVEF 55%, mild AR, mildly dilated aortic root, dilated proximal ascending aorta [4.4 cm].
- MPI [12/2023] - exercised for 11 METs with normal myocardial perfusion. 
- LHC [05/2024] - Non-obstructive CAD. <30% stenosis of RPDA and D1. 
- Continue aspirin 81 mg daily
- Continue metoprolol tartrate 12.5 mg BID. 
- Continue lipitor 40 mg daily for a goal LDL of less than 70
            - Recent LDL was 45 [10/2024]
 
Regarding his ascending aortic dilation:
- CCTA [03/2023] - dilated ascending aorta [4.5 x 4.3 cm], dilated descending aorta [3.3 x 3.2 cm], mildly dilated aortic root [4.0 cm], tortuous descending aorta.
- TTE [06/2023] - mildly dilated aortic root, dilated proximal ascending aorta [4.4 cm].
- We will check a chest CTA to assess for worsening any aorta dilations.
 
Regarding his hypertension:
-Louis's blood pressure today is elevated with a reading of 140/72 mmHg on arrival.
- Continue norvasc 5 mg daily
- Continue losartan-hctz 100-12.5 mg daily
- Continue beta-blocker bid for increased BP control
-I advised Louis to monitor his blood pressure at home regularly and to keep a log of his readings.
 
We discussed exercising for 30-45 minutes on most days of the week, maintaining a healthy weight and following a low-salt, heart-healthy diet. Otherwise, we will see Louis back to review the results of his chest CTA. 
 
Patient counseled on acute issues and verbalized understanding.

- Compared to prior TTE [05/2024], new severe LV dilatation, new findings show mitral stenosis worsened [mild -> mild to moderate]. 
- LVEF: 65% [08/2021] -> 44% [12/2022] -> 55-60% [04/2023] -> 52% [05/2024] -> 54% [12/2024] 
- Weight today: 192 lbs [-9 lb since last visit]
            - We advised Solomon to check weight at home. 
            - proBNP: 2820 [08/2023] -> 1965 [12/20/2024] -> 1843 [12/23/2024]
- Holding spirolactone 12.5 mg daily
- Continue lasix 20 mg daily due. 
            - Previously held lasix 20 mg three times a week due to low blood pressure and recent near syncopal episode.
- Continue metoprolol tartrate 25 mg BID. 
- Holding Entresto 24-26 mg BID
- I advised Solomon to monitor his daily weight and symptoms. 
- We discussed that his lower extremity edema is due to infection and not cardiac in etiology. 
            - We will refer Solomon to Dr. Sharma for wound care. 
 
Regarding his coronary artery disease:
- s/p 3x CABG with LIMA to OM, RIMA to LAD, and SVG to PDA in 2018.
- LHC [08/2015] - III Vessel CAD [RCA, LAD, LCx]

            - 50-60% stenosis of the proximal LCx [large size, mild disease - branching vessel]
            - <30% stenosis of the distal LM
            - severe diffuse disease of the RPDA and RPL1 RCA and proximal ramus intermedius [large size, severe disease] 
           - mild diffuse disease LPL1 LCx
- MPI [04/2023] - normal myocardial perfusion. 
- PYP Scan [06/2024] - Not suggestive of TTR amyloid: A semi-quantitative visual score of 0 or H/CL ratio < 1.
- Continue aspirin 81 mg daily.
- Continue omeprazole 20 mg daily. 
- Continue lipitor 10 mg daily for a goal LDL of less than 70. 
            - Recent LDL was 48 [08/2024]
 
Regarding his atrial fibrillation with a CHADsVASC score of at least 4 [age, CHF, HTN, PVD] and bradycardia: 
- EKG [01/27/2025] - shows sinus bradycardia [49 bpm] with 1st degree AV block, borderline prolonged QT interval, possible left atrial abnormality, rSr'(V1) probable normal variant, nonspecific lateral T wave abnormality.
            - Compared to prior EKG [12/20/2024] - newly noted sinus bradycardia with 1st degree AV block, borderline prolonged QT interval, possible left atrial abnormality, rSr'(V1) probable normal variant, nonspecific lateral T wave abnormality; previously noted possible ectopic atrial bradycardia, incomplete RBBB.
- Recent H/H was 8.2/25.0 [12/23/2024] 
- Given his thrombocytopenia, Plt (90 prev. 07/2021) and risk of bleeding, eliquis 5 mg twice daily was held. Recent Plt 107 [12/23/2024]. 
            - Continue aspirin 81 mg daily for stroke risk reduction.
- Event Monitor [05/10/2022 - 05/23/2022] - no AF burden, 2% PVCs, <1% PACs, 1 episode of SVT occurred with fastest run 47 bpm, 1 episode of Heart Block occurred with the most severe 1° and slowest 50 bpm, avg HR 58 bpm [47-120 bpm].
- PPM Interrogation [02/05/2024] - device functions appropriately. RTC in 6 months. 
- Given bradycardia, we gave Solomon a 2 week Event Monitor to assess for any significant arrhythmias, pauses, or AV block. However, he refused to wear the monitor. We advised him that it would be beneficial to wear the monitor given bradycardia and Solomon understands risks of not wearing monitor.
- Continue amiodarone 200 mg daily. 
- Continue beta blocker as above. 
- Solomon should continue following with Dr. Miller for routine device interrogations. 
 
Regarding his hypertension:
- Solomon's blood pressure today was controlled with a reading of 118/72 mmHg on arrival.
- Holding Entresto 24-26 mg BID  
- Continue beta blocker as above. 
- Holding spirolactone 12.5 mg daily
- I advised Solomon to monitor his blood pressure at home regularly and to keep a log of his readings. 
 
We discussed exercising for 30-45 minutes on most days of the week, maintaining a healthy weight and following a low-salt, heart-healthy diet. We discussed the importance of maintaining a low sodium heart healthy diet and regular exercise as part of conservative management of his coronary artery disease. Otherwise, we will see Solomon back in 6 months for a follow up.

Assessment and Plan
 
Assessment: Moses is a 35 y.o. male who has no past medical history on file.
 
Briefly, Mr. Levy has history significant for MVP with mitral regurgitation.. 
 
Regarding his MVP with MR: 
- EKG [02/22/2023] - unremarkable; 
- Stress echocardiogram [08/2020] - Resting: Normal left ventricular size and function. Mild posterior mitral valve prolapse. Mild -moderate mitral regurgitation. Exercise: No evidence of myocardial ischemia at heart rates attained. The mitral regurgitation does not significantly worsen at peak stress.
- TTE [06/2021] - LVEF of 56%. Dilated left atrial cavity. Mild to moderate mitral regurgitation. Mild to moderate tricuspid regurgitation. Mild pulmonic regurgitation. Compared to prior TTE [08/2020], new findings show new mild pulmonic regurgitation. 
- CCTA [06/2021] - calcium score 0. No calcified aortic plaque. 
            - Recent LDL 139 [02/2023]
- I reviewed the (preliminary) results of Moses's TTE with him 
            - (preliminary) TTE [2/22/2023] -  Irregular HR. Mild MVP with mild to moderate MR. Good LVEF. 
- Moses will need serial echocardiograms to monitor his degree of MVP and MR [02/2024]
 
Regarding his palpitations 
- 24hr Holter Monitor [08/05/2020] - average HR of 87 bpm [54-131 bpm], sinus rhythm. No arrhythmias noted. 
- Mitral regurgitation could be contributing to his symptoms.
-  I also advised Moses to reduce his caffeine and alcohol intake, as well as stay hydrated as this can contribute to his symptoms. We also discussed stress/anxiety and fatigue may also be contributing to his symptoms as well. 
 
His blood pressure today is normal with a reading of 134/72 mmHg on arrival. We discussed the importance of maintaining a low sodium heart healthy diet, weight loss, and regular exercise as part of risk reduction for the development of coronary artery disease. Otherwise, we will see Moses back in 1 year to repeat an echocardiogram and monitor MVP with MR. 
 
We discussed exercising for 30-45 minutes on most days of the week, maintaining a healthy weight and following a low-salt, heart-healthy diet.
 
Patient counseled on acute issues and verbalized understanding.

Assessment and Plan
 
Assessment: Elizabeth is a 63 y.o. female who has a past medical history of Hyperlipidemia.
 
Briefly, Ms. Lopez has a history significant for hyperlipidemia, PVCs, peripheral vascular disease s/p venous foam sclerotherapy of the left GSV [05/2024], left breast pain with acute mastitis [2017], arthritis, obesity, chronic back pain, family history of stroke [mother].
 
Regarding her chest pain and hyperlipidemia:
- CCTA [04/2023] - calcium score 0, normal coronaries, incidental finding: hepatic stenosis.
- Recent LDL was 135 [03/2023] which is not at recommended range of less than 100, though we discussed a lower LDL below 70 aids with further risk reduction for the development coronary artery disease. 
            - Given CCTA results as above, will continue aggressive lifestyle modifications at this time.
 
Regarding her valvular disease:
- TTE [04/2023] - mild concentric LVH, grade I diastolic dysfunction, LVEF of 59%, no significant valvular regurgitation, no significant pericardial effusion. 
- Compared to prior TTE [12/2020], previously noted mild MR, mild TR, mildly dilated LA. 
 
Regarding her PVCs:
- ODA EKG [09/04/2024] - slow sinus rhythm [59 bpm], left axis deviation.
- EKG today shows sinus rhythm with borderline 1st degree AV block, possible anterior infarct, nonspecific inferior/lateral ST-T abnormality.
- Elizabeth denies any symptoms at this time
- I advised Elizabeth to reduce her caffeine and alcohol intake, as well as stay hydrated as this can contribute to her symptoms. 
 
Regarding her PVD:
- s/p venous foam sclerotherapy of the left GSV [05/14/2024]
- Dr. Sharma [11/06/2024] - Patient no longer with venous insufficiency symptoms after radiofrequency venous ablation procedures 
- Continue following up with Dr. Sharma [vascular] for further evaluation
 
Elizabeth's blood pressure today is normal with a reading of 124/78 mmHg on arrival. 
 
We discussed the importance of maintaining a low sodium heart healthy diet, weight loss, and regular exercise as part of conservative management of her hyperlipidemia. Otherwise, we will see Elizabeth back in 6 months for follow up.

Assessment and Plan
 
Assessment: Lizette is a 67 y.o. female who has no past medical history on file.
 
Briefly, Ms. Morales has a history significant for hypertension. 
 
Regarding her hypertension and coronary work up:
- EKG [07/30/2023] - normal sinus rhythm
-Lizette's blood pressure today is elevated with a reading of 150/86 mmHg on arrival.
-TTE [08/02/2023] -  Borderline Mild LVH. EF 66%. 
- She was previously on enalapril-HCTZ by her PCP, switched to losartan-hctz at last visit
- Continue with losartan-HCTZ 100-25 mg daily
-I advised Lizette to monitor her blood pressure at home regularly and to keep a log of her readings.
 
We discussed exercising for 30-45 minutes on most days of the week, maintaining a healthy weight and following a low-salt, heart-healthy diet. Otherwise, we will see Lizette back after her surgery to re-assess her blood pressure . 
 
Lizette has a baseline activity tolerance of 4+ METs and long-standing hypertension. Lizette has preserved left ventricular function of 66% by echocardiogram [08/2023]. Lizette is presently optimised and stable from a cardiac perspective and can proceed with the planned gastrointestinal stomach tumor (GIST) excision at acceptable cardiac risk. There is no indication for further preoperative cardiac testing.

Assessment and Plan
 
Assessment: Mayer is a 76 y.o. male who has a past medical history of Atrial fibrillation, Diabetes mellitus, Hyperlipidemia, and Hypertension.
 
Briefly, Mr. Samuel has a history significant for hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes, non-obstructive coronary artery disease [05/2014], HOCM, atrial fibrillation on Xarelto s/p ILR [07/2020], atrial flutter s/p ablation [2014] by Dr. Lerman at Cornell.  
 
Regarding his paroxysmal atrial fibrillation with a CHADs2VASC score of 5 [age, HTN, CAD, diabetes]:
- s/p ILR implant [07/02/2020]
- EKG today shows possible ectopic atrial bradycardia [56 bpm], RBBB with LAFB, possible lateral infarct.
            - Compared to prior EKG [08/21/2024] - newly noted possible lateral infarct.
- ILR Interrogation [05/2023] - Battery status ok. No conduction abnormalities or PAF events. 
- ILR interrogation [01/2024] - Sinus rhythm. AF burden: 0%. No PAF events. No conduction abnormalities/tachyarrhythmias noted. 
            -Continue following with Dr. Mehta for routine ILR interrogations
-Continue Xarelto 10 mg daily for stroke risk reduction
            - Mayer's doctor at NYU decreased his xarelto from 20 to 10 mg daily due to minor tongue bleeding, but Mayer stopped taking it entirely for the past few days. We advised him that he must resume taking xarelto and that he can remain on the 10 mg dose as of now.
            - I advised him to follow up with a dentist about his tongue bleeding, then to return at follow up to reassess his xarelto dose.
            - I advised Mayer to take xarelto with food.
-Continue metoprolol succinate 25 mg BID. 
 
Regarding his HOCM and valvular disease:
-I reviewed the results of Mayer's echocardiogram with him.
            - TTE [12/2023] - Severe asymmetric septal hypertrophy. LVEF of 65%. Mildly dilated LA. Systolic anterior motion of the mitral valve [resting LVOT gradient = 45 mmHg, Valsalva gradient = 65 mmHg, standing gradient = 84 mmHg]. Mild MR. Mitral annular calcification. Aortic valve is trileaflet and sclerotic vs mild stenosis. Mild AR. Mild TR. No significant pericardial effusion. Ascending aorta is mildly dilated [3.8 cm]. 
                        - Compared to prior TTE [06/2020] - Newly noted severe asymmetric septal hypertrophy (previously moderate concentric LVH). Possible new mild aortic stenosis vs sclerotic valve. Previously noted grade I diastolic dysfunction, moderate LVOT obstruction, and evidence of HOCM. Improved AR [mild-moderate > mild] and improved MR [moderate>mild].
- Mayer will need serial echocardiograms to monitor the degree of his LVH, HOCM, valvular disease, and ascending aorta dilation.
-Continue his beta-blocker as above. 
 
Regarding his coronary artery disease with angina:
- Coronary CT [2014] -a calcium score in the 85th percentile, <50% occlusion of the mid LAD, <30% occlusion of the mid LCx.
- MPI [05/2021] - normal myocardial perfusion.  
-I reviewed the results of Mayer's nuclear stress test with him.
            - MPI [12/2023] - normal myocardial perfusion.
- Mayer is on Xarelto for AFIB. 
- Continue metformin 500 mg BID.  
-Continue atorvastatin 10 mg daily for a goal LDL of less than 70.
            - Recent LDL was 56 [10/2024]
 
Regarding his hypertension:
- Blood pressure today is elevated with a reading of 168/78 mmHg on arrival.
- Continue beta-blocker as above
            - If his blood pressure remains elevated at follow up, we can consider increasing his beta blocker.
- Continue losartan-hctz 50-12.5 mg daily
- Continue amlodipine 2.5 mg daily 
- I advised Mayer to monitor his blood pressure at home regularly and to keep a log of his readings.
- Mayer does snore so he may benefit from a sleep study to assess for sleep apnea which may be contributing to his elevated blood pressure. We will consider this next visit. 
 
We discussed the importance of maintaining a low sodium heart healthy diet, weight loss, and regular exercise as part of conservative management of his coronary artery disease. Otherwise, we will see Mayer back in 6 months for follow up.

Outside Physician Notes
04/28/2025 – Amir Mayer MD (Sick Visit)  
  • HPI: 37-year-old female with chest tightness initially right sided with cough, progressive SOB on exertion and at rest, now left-sided chest pain radiating to left arm.  
  • Vitals: Ht 63 in Wt 239 lb BP 142/90 HR 97 O2 sat 99% BMI 42.33  
  • Exam: Clear lungs, normal S1/S2, no murmurs, FROM x4.  
  • Assessment: Atypical chest pain; morbid obesity; dietary counseling.  
  • Plan: ECG recording; referral to cardiology.  

Past Medical History
- Obesity  
- Irregular bleeding  

Current Medication List  
• Pepcid 40 mg orally once daily  
• Fluticasone Propionate 50 mcg nasal spray once daily  
• AYR Saline Nasal Rinse as directed nasally  
• Terconazole 0.8% cream vaginally at bedtime for 3 days  

Discrepancy: Prior cardiology note lists Norethin Ace-Eth Estrad-FE daily; 04/28/2025 outside note indicates patient is not taking Norethin – clarify adherence.  

Recommendations
- Consider repeat TTE to assess current cardiac structure/function given persistent chest pain  
- Obtain exercise stress test or stress echocardiogram to evaluate for inducible ischemia  
- Initiate lipid-lowering therapy (e.g., moderate-intensity statin) given TC 275 and TG 565  
- Review need for ambulatory rhythm monitoring to evaluate palpitations and atypical chest pain

- On exam: Mild mitral murmur. Unchanged. 
- His weight today is 191 lbs [-2.9 lbs last visit].
- Will continue to hold furosemide 20 mg twice a week [Monday/Thursday] at this time 
- I advised Erwin to regularly monitor his weight and his symptoms.
 
Regarding his hypertension:
- Blood pressure today is elevated with a reading of 160/70 mmHg on arrival. 
- Continue losartan 25 mg daily
            - If echo at follow up shows LVH, we will consider increasing losartan. 
            - If echo at follow up doesn't show LVH, we can hold off on increasing losartan or adding other medications. 
- I advised Erwin to monitor his blood pressure at home regularly and to keep a log of his readings.
 
 We discussed the importance of maintaining a low sodium heart healthy diet and regular exercise as part of conservative management of his coronary artery disease. Otherwise, we will see Erwin back to check an echocardiogram. 
 
We discussed exercising for 30-45 minutes on most days of the week, maintaining a healthy weight and following a low-salt, heart-healthy diet.
 
Patient counseled on acute issues and verbalized understanding.

- Simcha is on eliquis for AFIB. 
 
Regarding her hypertension:
- Her blood pressure today is well-controlled with a reading of 115/69 mmHg on arrival.
- Continue beta blocker as above
- I advised Simcha to monitor her blood pressure at home regularly and to keep a log of her readings. 
 
Given the pigmented rash on the lower back, we will prescribe Simcha lotrisone cream. 
 
We discussed the importance of maintaining a low sodium heart healthy diet, weight loss, and regular exercise as part of conservative ma nagement of her hypertension. Otherwise, we will see her back to reassess her symptoms and consider LHC+RHC. 
 
Patient counseled on acute issues and verbalized understanding.
